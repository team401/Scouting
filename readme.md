## Features

- ***Offline data collection***: users can populate scouting form and a QR Code is automatically generated on submission that contains comma seperated values to import into Google Spreadsheet or custom script

- ***Online data submission***: When Wifi or cellular service is available, the form will automatically submit to a supabase database and calculate averages
